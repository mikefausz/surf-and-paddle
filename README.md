##HTML - Surf & Paddle
Let's create an active web page from an image mockup.

###You Should Know
* HTML
* CSS Layout
* CSS Animations
* Responsive Web Design

###Your Mission
As a web developer, you'll sometimes be tasked with creating an HTML page from an image file. Let's take a complex image and turn it into a functioning web page. We'll use this image as our layout guide:

####Explore Mode
**Challenge #1.1:** Let's work on our CSS & HTML by creating an identical layout to the above image. Put your HTML in index.html and your CSS in styles.css. Any images you use should be in an images directory. Try to get as close to "pixel perfect" as possible! 
**Goal #1.1:** Create the Surf & Paddle web page from scratch based on the given image.

**Challenge #1.2:** Enliven your page with some CSS animation! To complete this challenge, at minimum, you must have color transitions on your bottom & sidebar images and your "Comments", "Later", and "Share" buttons. Get creative and add any transitions or interactivity you'd like, though! Can you find any good places to include animated text or graphics? 
**Goal #1.2:** Update your CSS (and possibly HTML) to include transitions & animation.

**Challenge #1.3:** As always, ensure your work is in source control. Create a git repo of your finished project and upload it to Github. 
**Goal #1.3:** Submit your Github URL below.

####Adventure Mode
**Challenge 2.1:** Now that you have a solid desktop layout, why not add a responsive view for mobile browsers? Make your web page responsive, matching this mockup image (images/surf-and-paddle-responsive.pdf) at smaller widths. 
**Goal 2.1:** Add responsive styles to your web page.

####Epic Mode
**Challenge #3.1:** Ensure your layouts are pixel-perfect with the original images. You can use PerfectPixel for Chrome to overlay your web page with the mockup images. Make sure any transitions comply with this strict styling as well! 
**Goal #3.1:** Check for pixel-perfection and adjust your web page as necessary.
